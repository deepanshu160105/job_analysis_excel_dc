# 📊 Data Science Job Market Analysis – Excel Project

## 📌 Project Overview

As a student and job seeker, I wanted to understand how skills affect salaries in the data science job market. This project analyzes real-world job data from 2023 using Microsoft Excel to find trends in job roles, salaries, and in-demand skills.

The goal was to answer practical questions like:
- Do more skills lead to higher pay?
- How do salaries differ by region?
- What skills are most in demand?
- Which skills are linked to the highest salaries?

---

## 🧠 Tools & Skills Used

This project was completed entirely in **Microsoft Excel** using:

- Power Query (ETL – Extract, Transform, Load)
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Pivot (Data Model)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains real-world job postings from 2023, including:

- Job Titles  
- Salaries  
- Locations  
- Required Skills  

The data was imported, cleaned, and modeled using Power Query before analysis.

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Findings

### ✅ 1. Do More Skills Mean Higher Pay?

I found a **positive correlation** between number of skills and salary.  
Jobs like **Senior Data Engineer** and **Data Scientist** showed higher pay when more skills were required.  
Roles like **Business Analyst** had fewer skills and lower salaries.

### ✅ 2. Salary Across Different Regions

Using PivotTables and DAX:
- U.S.-based jobs had significantly higher median salaries.
- Senior technical roles paid well globally, but the U.S. showed the biggest salary advantage.

---

### ✅ 3. Most In-Demand Skills

Top required skills across data roles were:

- SQL  
- Python  
- Cloud tools like AWS and Azure  

This shows a strong industry focus on backend and cloud-based data processing.

### ✅ 4. Salary by Top Skills

Skills linked to the **highest salaries** were:

- Python  
- SQL  
- Oracle  

Skills like **PowerPoint** and **Word** were linked to the lowest salary ranges.

---

## 📈 Techniques Used

- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
- Power Pivot for creating relationships between job and skill tables  
- DAX measures for calculating median salaries  
- Pivot Charts for comparison and visualization
